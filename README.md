## Hi there

Currently a personal trainer and coach, I am seeking to transition into a career that aligns with my interests in **IT security**. Looking for **junior** roles within a company's security team where I can learn a wide range of topics and think on my feet. I have been learning **Python** in my free time and have recently completed the Azure fundamentals course (AZ900).

I enjoy (3D) puzzles, gaming (World of Warcraft, Halo, Destiny), sudoku and podcasts.

I have an avid interest in Mathematics and Cyber Security and Iâ€™m a quick study. Iâ€™ve experimented with JavaScript, vcs, and package managers.

My email address is z.vdorp@gmail.com
